//! \brief  Makes sure the comment style is conform the specified standard.
//!
//! Currently the standard states that code should be commented using 2
//! consecutive slashes (//), the other way(s(?)) are not allowed. If a slash
//! followed by an asterisk is encountered, this module indicates the file does
//! not match the standard.
//!
//! In future releases, this module should also be able to fix the issues by
//! replacing the occurrences of these comment blocks with either a block of
//! single line comments, or with a preprocessor directive. Though the former
//! is more appalling since comments most likely don't contain compilable code.
