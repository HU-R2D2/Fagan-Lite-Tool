//! @brief		This class is used for file searching within a directory,
//!             and it's subdirectories.
//!				It does so by calling the constructor with the
//!             base directory as a string.
//!				When this is done, the method get_files can be called,
//!             to return the legal files.
//! @warning 	As of yet, only cpp, hpp and h files are
//!             supported as legal files,
//!				the rest are discarded and ignored.

    //!                 for files and folders.
