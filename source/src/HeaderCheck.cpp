//! \brief  Performs various checks on the doxygen comments in any specified file.
//!
//! The various checks include:
//! - whether or not each comment block contains a brief description;
//! - The file includes the copyright notice, and whether all fields are
//!   replaced so the standard values no longer remain. (checking for the actual
//!   author is practically impossible.)
